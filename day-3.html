  <h1>Putting two strings together.</h1>

  <p>We will look at two operators for strings. + and +=. </p>
  <p>The + operator just combines two strings.</p>
  <p>The += operator adds on to the end of the string. We call this appending to the end of the string.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>Lets take two fruits and invent a new fruit.</p>
  <p>I like strawberies I also like watermelon. Let's create a strawberrywatermelon</p>
  <script>
    let f1, f2;
    f1 = "strawberry";
    f2 = "watermelon";
    document.write(f1 + f2);
  </script>
  <h3>Try it!</h3>
  <p>Let's try it for two more fruits!</p>
  <script>
    // Try it! 
    let f4, f5;
    f4 = "mango";
    f5 = "apple";
    document.write(f4 + f5);
  </script>
  <p> Try it! One more time, make up a new fruit! </p>
  <h3>Another Example</h3>
  <p> You can use the + operator mulitple times to combine more strings. Let's improve our fruit names by inserting a
    "-" between them.</p>
  <p>I like
    <script>
      let f11, f12;
      f1 = "plum";
      f2 = "grape";
      document.write(f1 + "-" + f2);
    </script>
  </p>
  <h3>Try it!</h3>
  <p>Now use the + operator to put a "-" into your fruit names.</p>
  <p>
    I also like:
    <script>
      let f6, f7;
      f6 = "pineapple";
      f7 = "cherry";
      document.write(f6 + "_"+ f7);
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    But my favorite is:
    <script>
      let f8, f9;
      f8 = "orange";
      f9 = "bananna";
      document.write(f8 +"_"+ f9);
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Example of +=</h2>
  <p>Let's look at the += operator. It looks funny, but is very useful sometimes.</p>
  <p> It adds on to the end of the string.</p>
  <p>Maybe I want a fruit that is not just 1 but many fruits combined. I want a strawberry watermellon cherry!</p>
  <script>
    let fruit1;
    fruit1 = "strawberry";
    fruit1 += "watermellon";
    fruit1 += "cherry";
  </script>
  <p>
    I really want a...
    <script>
      let fruit10;
      fruit10 = "grape";
      fruit10 += "avacado";
      fruit10 += "tomato";
      document.write(fruit10);
    </script>
  </p>
  <h3>Try it!</h3>
  <p>Try to make a fruit that is a combo of three or more fruits.</p>
  <script>
    let fruit2;
    fruit2 = "peach";
    fruit2 += "melon";
    fruit2 +="blueberries";
    document.write(fruit2);
  </script>
  <p>
    The best fruit in the world would be a...
    <script>
      let fruit3;
      fruit3  ="aloe";
      fruit3 +="fern";
      fruit3 +="squash";


      document.write(fruit3);
    </script>
  </p>
  <h3>Try it!</h3>
  <p> Try one more with even more fruits combined. Bonus: can you add a "-" between the fruit names?</p>

  <p>
    Really, the best is...
    <script>
      let fruit4;
      fruit4 ="rasberry";
      fruit4 +="blackberry";
      fruit4 +="pumpkin";
      document.write(fruit4);



    </script>
